What is CrackedEarth, you may ask?
CrackedEarth is a server on Minecraft (hosted on Aternos), which is in a 1:4000 map of Earth! Plugins help the server to be what it truly is such as the UltimateEconomy plugin, which has a town, economy, nation & more features! More info on that in this link: https://github.com/catch441/Ultimate_Economy/wiki. Links for the custom economy commands down below:
